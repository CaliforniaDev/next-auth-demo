# NextAuth Demo

This repository serves as a practice project for implementing **NextAuth.js**, a flexible and easy-to-integrate authentication library for Next.js applications. The project follows along with a course to demonstrate best practices and practical use cases for setting up authentication in modern web applications. ‚ú®

## Key Features

- **Email and Password Authentication**
- **OAuth Integration** (e.g., Google, GitHub)
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **Session Management**
- **Database Integration** (e.g., PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM)
- **Password Reset Functionality**
- **Secure Route Protection**

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication library for Next.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing user data.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Simplified ORM for interacting with the database.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for enhanced developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library for building modern UIs.
- **React Hook Form & Zod**: Tools for efficient form handling and validation.
- **Resend**: For reliable email communication. üìö

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- A GitHub or Google developer account for OAuth setup (optional)

### Installation üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/next-auth-demo.git
   cd next-auth-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Installation of npm Packages üì¶

To install the required npm packages, run the following command:

```bash
npm install next-auth @next-auth/prisma-adapter drizzle-orm tailwindcss shadcn/ui react-hook-form zod
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

- `pages/`: Contains Next.js pages, including API routes for authentication.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components like login forms.
- `lib/`: Utility functions and configuration files.
- `db/`: Database models and migration files (e.g., Drizzle ORM setup).

## Learning Goals üéì

- Understand how to configure and use NextAuth.js.
- Learn to implement various authentication providers.
- Explore secure session handling.
- Integrate PostgreSQL with Next.js using Drizzle ORM.
- Gain hands-on experience with TypeScript in authentication workflows.
- Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
- Create password reset functionality and protect sensitive routes.
